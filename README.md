This is a small repo for me to get up to speed with using OpenCV in Python instead of C++ 

Topics covered will be: 
* Reading Photos / Videos 
* Image transformation
* ![Image showing transformation matrix](https://github.com/GutesBrot/OpenCVPractice/blob/main/Explanation%20Pictures/TransformationMatrix.jpeg?raw=true)
* Color spaces 
* Edge detection 
* Face detection 
* Face recognition 
* some Deep learning
